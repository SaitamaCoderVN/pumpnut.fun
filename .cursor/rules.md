# Solana Development Rules

## MCP Integration
When working on Solana projects, the following MCP tools are available:
- Solana Expert: Ask detailed questions about Solana development
- Documentation Search: Search Solana documentation
- Anchor Framework Expert: Get help with Anchor-specific topics

## Best Practices
1. **Security First**: Always validate accounts and implement proper access control
2. **Error Handling**: Use custom error types and handle all edge cases
3. **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for all program logic
4. **Documentation**: Document all instructions, accounts, and data structures

## Common Patterns
- Use PDA for program-owned accounts
- Implement proper account validation
- Handle compute unit limits
- Use versioned transactions when needed

## Code Style
- Follow Rust conventions for Solana programs
- Use TypeScript for client applications
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Add descriptive comments for complex logic
